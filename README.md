 Interactive To-Do List
 
Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. Firstly, start with a basic HTML structure. Then, use JavaScript to handle user interactions and update the list dynamically. Next, focus on implementing features like adding new tasks, checking off completed tasks, and deleting tasks. Additionally, enhance the project by incorporating features such as storing tasks in the browserâ€™s local storage, enabling task prioritization, or adding due dates.
